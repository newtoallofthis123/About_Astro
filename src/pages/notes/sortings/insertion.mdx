Insertion sort is a comparitive sorting algorithm. It is a simple sorting algorithm that works the way we sort playing cards in our hands.

## How it works

Insertion sort iterates, consuming one input element each repetition, and growing a sorted output list. At each iteration, insertion sort removes one element from the input data, finds the location it belongs within the sorted list, and inserts it there. It repeats until no input elements remain.
It is basically a glorified form of swapping. So, in bubble sort, we compare two adjacent elements and swap them if they are not in order. In insertion sort, we compare an element with the elements to its left and swap them if they are not in order. We keep doing this until we reach the beginning of the array.
The way they are sorted is also a bit different. The left element is plucked out and compared with the elements to its left. If it is smaller, it is swapped with the element to its left. This continues until the element is in its correct position. This is repeated for all the elements in the array.

## Implementation
Python
```python
def insertion_sort(arr):
    for i in range(1, len(arr)):
        j = i
        while j > 0 and arr[j] < arr[j-1]:
            arr[j], arr[j-1] = arr[j-1], arr[j]
            j -= 1
    return arr
```
C
```c
void insertion_sort(int arr[], int n) {
    int i, j, temp;
    for (i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        j = i;
        while (j > 0 && arr[j] < arr[j-1]) {
            temp = arr[j];
            arr[j] = arr[j-1];
            arr[j-1] = temp;
            j--;
        }
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity
Time complexity of insertion sort is O(n^2). It is not efficient for large data sets as its average and worst case complexity are of ÎŸ(n2), where n is the number of items.
It is efficient for small data sets.
Not very different from bubble sort, but insertion sort is more efficient for small data sets.

## Space Complexity
The space complexity of insertion sort is O(1), because only a single additional memory space is required i.e. for temp variable.
