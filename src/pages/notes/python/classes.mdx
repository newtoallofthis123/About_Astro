Classes in python are a way to create your own data types. 
They are very similar to structs in C++ and Java.
Classes help use create code abstractions and make our code more readable and maintainable.

## Creating a class

To create a class in python we use the `class` keyword followed by the name of the class.

```python
class Person:
    pass
```

> The `pass` keyword is used to tell python that we are not going to write any code in the class yet.

A class can have attributes and methods. Attributes are variables that are associated with the class and methods are functions that are associated with the class.
So, classes are like blue prints for objects. We can create objects from a class.

## Creating an object

An object is a certain instance of a class. We can create an object from a class by calling the class name as if it were a function.

```python
class Person:
    pass

person1 = Person()
```

> The `person1` object is an instance of the `Person` class.

## Adding attributes to a class

We can add attributes to a class by using the `self` keyword. The `self` keyword is used to refer to the current object.

```python
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

person1 = Person("John", 36)

print(person1.name)

# Output: John
```

The self key word is used to refer to the current object. The `__init__` method is called the constructor. It is called when an object is created from the class.
It is used to initialize the object.

## Adding methods to a class

A method is a function that you can run for the object. We can add methods to a class by defining a function inside the class.

```python
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

    def say_hello(self):
        print("Hello, my name is " + self.name)

person1 = Person("John", 36)
person1.say_hello()

# Output: Hello, my name is John
```

## Inheritance

Inheritance is a way to create a new class from an existing class. The new class is called the child class and the existing class is called the parent class.

```python
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

    def say_hello(self):
        print("Hello, my name is " + self.name)

class Student(Person):
    def __init__(self, name, age, grade):
        super().__init__(name, age)
        self.grade = grade

    def say_grade(self):
        print("My grade is " + self.grade)

student1 = Student("John", 36, "A")
student1.say_hello()

# Output: Hello, my name is John
```

In this case the `Student` class inherits from the `Person` class. The `Student` class is the child class and the `Person` class is the parent class.

## Overriding methods

We can override methods in the parent class by defining a method with the same name in the child class.

```python
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

    def say_hello(self):
        print("Hello, my name is " + self.name)

    def __str__(self):
        return "Name: " + self.name + ", Age: " + str(self.age)
```

In this case we have overridden the `__str__` method. This method is called when we try to convert the object to a string.
Hence, when we try to print the object, the `__str__` method is called.

```bash
print(person1)
# Output: Name: John, Age: 36
```

## Encapsulation

Encapsulation is a way to restrict access to certain methods and attributes. We can do this by using the `__` prefix.

```python
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
    
    def __say_hello(self):
        print("Hello, my name is " + self.name)

    def say_hello(self):
        self.__say_hello()

person1 = Person("John", 36)
person1.say_hello()
```

Here, the `__say_hello` method is private. It can only be accessed from within the class. We can access it from the `say_hello` method because it is in the same class.
This is a way to hide the implementation details of the class from the user.

## Getters and Setters

Getters and setters are methods that are used to get and set the values of attributes. We can use getters and setters to access private attributes.

```python
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.__name = name
        self.__age = age
    
    def get_name(self):
        return self.__name

    def set_name(self, name):
        self.__name = name

person1 = Person("John", 36)
print(person1.get_name())
```

Here, we have created a getter and setter for the `name` attribute. We can use these methods to get and set the value of the `name` attribute.

Overall, classes are a very useful feature of python. They help us create code abstractions and make our code more readable and maintainable.
