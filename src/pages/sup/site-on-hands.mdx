Okay I find this quite funny, a friend of mine recently was *very* bored 
and as you do when you are bored, you start drawing on other people's hands.

So this friend of mine started drawning on my hand and ended up with this.

Cool right? I think so too.
Co incidentally, this was the stack I was using to build this site.
I was using Astro, React, JavaScript, TailwindCSS, VSCode and Music.

All of that is on my hands, and I think that's pretty cool.
This perfectly timed photo is all that is left of the drawing.

So, this is my site on my hands.
