A few weeks back, me, with a lot of enthusiasm, started a new routine. I even wrote a quip or
update as I call it, about it. But, as it happens with most of my routines, I couldn't stick to it
for long. I was doing good for about two weeks, but then a small change in my schedule, and I
couldn't follow it anymore. I tried to get back to it, but I couldn't. I was back to my old routine
which was having no routine at all.
