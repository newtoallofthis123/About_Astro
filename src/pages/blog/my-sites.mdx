> Speed, I am speed, Faster than fast, quicker than quick, I am lightning. <br/> - Lightning McQueen

Why do developers want their sites, apps, and even games to be like Lightning McQueen? To win the Piston Cup?
Or is there something more to it?

Now I know that there are so many great articles written on this topic on the internet and I am not going to bore you with the same stuff again.
I am just going to share my experience with you and why I think it really matters.

## Why do I care about website speeds?

Now I guess it makes more sense to tell you why I care about my website speeds.
So, for a little bit of a background, I like to think I am a full stack web developer, but to be honest, I am a front end developer who knows backend stuff.
I have been working in the Javascript ecosystem for a while now and I have worked on a lot of projects.
My first like "web application" was a Pastebin service I had made using the popular
python framework [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/).

This was quite a good experience for me, I learned a lot about backend development and how to make a web application.
However, one crucial thing I had ignored was my frontend.
The frontend for NoobPaste, as I had called it, was a simple HTML page with a form and a textarea.

Ofcourse it had a bit of CSS to make it look good and a codemirror instance to make the textarea look like a code editor, but other
than that, it was just a simple HTML page.
All the data was being sent to the backend using a simple POST request and for ever GET request, the backend would send the HTML page back to the client.
Now this way of doing things is not bad, but it is not good either.

Unbeknownst to me, I had created a website in 2020 that was living in 2010.
I had used Jquery ðŸ˜„ to make requests. Now don't get me wrong, Jquery is a great library and it helped me alot while learning web development,
but it is not something you should be using in 2020.

Looking back, I also hosted the site on a heroku free dyno, which meant that the site would go to sleep after 30 minutes of inactivity.
So, all in all, it took about 15 to 20 seconds for the site to load.
Yes. 15 to 20 seconds. Now, I know that is not a lot. I mean though I was not a web developer back in the windows XP days, I am pretty sure
that was the average time it took for a website to load back then and it was considered normal.

However, we live in 2023 now, where our attention spans are shorter than ever and we want everything to be fast and snappy.
Even 1 to 2 second changes are noticeable to us.
So, with all of this in mind, I decided to not make the same mistakes when designing my portfolio website.

## My Portfolio Site

So, I made the mistake of not caring about my website speeds once, but I was not going to make the same mistake again, until I did.
Looking back, I really don't blame myself. It was my first time just making a portfolio site that was well designed and I was really excited about it.
So excited, that I forgot to care about the performance of the site. This was even so bad because I had not even used any frameworks or libraries.
I had just used plain HTML, CSS and Javascript.

I had got so carried away with the design that I had forgotten to care about the performance of the site.
I had written horrible CSS and Javascript code that was not only hard to read, but also hard to maintain.
You might judge me, but on most elements, I had used inline styles even though they were already styled in the CSS file.
It was a whole big mess, something that you might expect from a self taught developer who didn't even complete the full tutorial.

However, that is one thing I always comend myself for. I never get stuck in the tutorial hell. I always try to make something of my own.
And that is what I did with my portfolio site. I made it from scratch. I did not use any templates or frameworks. I just made it from scratch.
Okay, why am I beating around the bush? I am just going to tell you the LSP (Load Speed Performance) of my site.

### LSP

One word, horrible. I mean, I am not going to lie, I was expecting it to be bad, but not this bad.
I had used a lot of images in my site, which I had not optimized at all. I had used a lot of CSS and Javascript, which I had not minified.
All in all, it was a mess.

So, the LSP was around 8 seconds. Yes, 8 seconds for a static site. I mean it is one thing for a full stack app to have that sort of a LSP but 
for a static site, it is just unacceptable. Looking back, it turns out I had just used a lot of images and I had not optimized them at all,
my css was about 500kb and my javascript was about 300kb. I mean, I don't know what I was thinking.

You can still access the site by going to [noobscience.surge.sh](https://noobscience.surge.sh) and you can see for yourself how bad it is.

<div class="text-center">
    <button class="btn bg-red-300 m-4">
        <a href="https://noobscience.surge.sh">
            Visit the old site
        </a>
    </button>
</div>

## Post Next Clarity

Please don't leave after the name :) After a lot of time and delaying to understand and learn React and Next.js, I finally decided to learn them.
As always, the way I started was bad, but I got better. I started with a simple create-react-app and then I moved on to Next.js.

You can actually check out my old react site by going to [old.noobscience.rocks](https://old.noobscience.rocks).

It's not the best, but it's not the worst either. I mean, it's a lot better than my old site. It has a LSP of about 3 seconds, which is not bad.
I had done a lot of things right with this site. I had used a lot of images, but I had optimized them. I had used a lot of CSS and Javascript,
but react had taken care of that for me. It was sort of perfect. So it was my portfolio for a while, until I decided to learn Next.js.

Now the reason I decided to learn Next.js was because I wanted to add dynamiciy to my site. I wanted to add a blog and well, an updates page.
So, I decided to learn Next.js. I had heard a lot of good things about it and I wanted to try it out for myself.
My first experience was not the best. My Javascript was not the best and I had not used any sort of state management library.

So, I had to use a lot of props and I had to pass them down a lot of components. It was a mess. However, overtime, I became good.
I even redesigned my site with the help of my friends, set up a mongoDB database and added a blog and an updates page.
Everything was dynamic and I was loving it. Google finally started indexing my site and that was when I realized that I had made a mistake.
I had not optimized my site for SEO. So, I did. I added meta tags and I added a sitemap and a robots.txt file.
All that good stuff. I even added a service worker to make my site a PWA.

Everything was going great, until I realized that my site was not as fast as I wanted it to be. I mean, it was fast, but not fast enough.
It was also not as accessible as I wanted it to be. I mean, it was accessible, but not as accessible as I wanted it to be.
The reason, the secret culprit that was causing all of this, bad css and client side rendering.

Now this Next.Js site was huge. It was about 9000 lines of code and it had taken me about 400 hours to make it.
To be fair, most of that time was spent learning Next.js and React, but still, it was a lot of time to invest in a site.
My Next.JS portfolio was a lot better than my old portfolio, but it was still not perfect. It was still not as fast as I wanted it to be.
I had made the mistake of adding too much dynamicity to my site, too many api calls, too many components, too many images.
So, even though it was a good site, it had a LSP of about 4 seconds.

Now, I know that 4 seconds is not a lot, but it is still not as fast as I wanted it to be. I wanted it to be as fast as possible.
No idea why, but I just wanted it to be as fast as possible. So, I decided to make a new site. A site that was fast, accessible and SEO optimized.

## Welcome Astro

![Astro](https://astro.build/assets/wallpapers/thumbs/desktop/arc.webp)

So, I had heard about Astro a while back, but I had not really paid attention to it. I mean, I was happy with Next.js and I did not want to change.
Infact, I had even used Astro and I had made a site with it. However, I had not really paid attention to it. I had just used it to make a small blog.

However, after I realized that my Next.js site was not as fast as I wanted it to be, I decided to give Astro another try.
The main thing I added to this however, was that I also decided to style my site with Tailwind CSS. I had heard a lot of good things about it
and I wanted to try it out for myself. So, I decided to use Tailwind CSS with Astro.

Now this combination was where things changed for me. I mean, I had used Tailwind CSS before, but I had not really used it to it's full potential.
My Next.js site was styled with custom sass, which was just the worst. I mean, I had used a lot of classes and I had not really used any sort of
utility classes. So, I decided to use Tailwind CSS with Astro and I was blown away. I mean, it was so easy to use and it was so fast.

It took my just 15 hours to nearly convert 80% of my Next.js site to Astro. I mean, it was just so easy to use. I was blown away.
All the dynamic elements of the Next.JS site were still there, but I had optimized them. I had used a lot of utility classes and I had used
a lot of Tailwind CSS components. I mean, it was just so easy to use. I was blown away.

Now Astro deserves a blog post, so I am not going to go into too much detail about it, but I will say this, it is amazing.

So, finally, after a lot of work and 2 years of learning, I finally have a site that I am proud of. It is fast, it is accessible and it is SEO optimized.
Guess what the LSP is? It is 0.5 seconds. Yes, 0.5 seconds. I mean, it is just so fast. I am so proud of it.

Yes! It is this site. This blog you are reading is just a `.mdx` file that is being rendered by Astro.
I am still working on it, but it is nearly done. I am quite happy with it. I added a good mobile menu and a lot of other things.
That is until I find something else. I mean, I love having a site so much, that I shall never truely be happy with it.

So, that is my story. I hope you enjoyed it. I hope you learned something from it and most importantly, I hope you learn from my mistakes.
If you do love this small blog, then please do share it with your friends. I would really appreciate it.
BTW, tell me what you think about it. I would love to hear your thoughts on it.
