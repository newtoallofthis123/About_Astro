Mathematics is very cool sometimes.
First off, I am no mathematian and as my grades show, I am not the best at math.
But I do find it very interesting.
So, for a first, I am going to talk some math, by telling you about a very 
cool problem I found. It's called the 52! problem.

## The Problem

Now, the premise is quite simple. Let's say you are a very good counter.
You know, a timer, a counter, a tally, whatever you want to call it.
Now, imagine you have set the timer for 52 factorial seconds.
For context, this is how long 52! seconds is:

```
80,658,175,170,943,876,845,634,591,553,351,679,477,960,544,579,306,048,386,139,594,686,464
```

That's a lot of seconds.
Now, if you don't know what factorials are, they are basically the product of
all the numbers from 1 to the number you are calculating the factorial of.
So basically:

$$
n! = n * (n-1) * (n-2) * ... * 1
$$

Now this might seem rather small, but it is actually a very big number.
The thing about factorials is that they grow very fast.
For example, the factorial of 5 is 120, 
but the factorial of 10 is 3,628,800.
So, you see, even if you double the number, the factorial grows by a lot.
Let's get back now.

So, as I was saying, you have set the timer for 52! seconds.
That's a lot of seconds, right?
Can't put that into perspective? Well, let's try.
We all know that the universe is about 13.8 billion years old.
That's lot of time, right? Well, let's see how many seconds that is.

$13,800,000,000 * 365 * 24 * 60 * 60 = 435,139,200,000,000$

Now, to do all that math, let's write a simple python script.
Now you can do this in other languages too, but you would need to do
a lot of memory management and stuff, so I am going to use python.

```python
def factorial(num) -> int:
    if num == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return num * factorial(num-1)

fact = factorial(52)
print(f'The Factorial of the number 52 is {fact:,.0f}')
days = fact / (60*60*24)
print("Now calculating years")
years = days / 365
print(f'The number of years is {years:,.0f}')
universes = years / 13.8e9
print(f'That is {universes:,.0f} universes')
```

Now, if you run this, you will get the following output:

```
The Factorial of the number 52 is 80,658,175,170,943,876,845,634,591,553,351,679,477,960,544,579,306,048,386,139,594,686,464
Now calculating years
The number of years is 2,557,653,956,460,676,127,185,104,076,976,681,458,060,810,360,460,580,598,317,056
This is 185,337,243,221,788,120,512,221,295,733,831,336,272,352,981,811,200 universe lifetimes
```

Yes. It's that big.
So, let's imagine this scenario.
You have set the timer for 52! seconds.
And you start at the equator.
Every 1billion years, you move one meter.
Now, you have to walk all the way around the earth.
Every time you walk around the earth, you put a drop of water in the pacific ocean.
When the pacific ocean is full, you put a piece of paper on the ground.
When the stack of paper reaches the sun, you take a look at the timer.

You would have to do this 185,337,243,221,788,120,512,221,295,733,831,336,272,352,981,811,200 times.
That's a lot of times.
